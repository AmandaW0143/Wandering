            <p>The warmth of the lantern offers a fragile sense of comfort. You press forward through the fog, the sound of bamboo rustling in silence. With every step, the thick mist seems to part slightly, as though the forest is consciously guiding you. The bamboo stalks seem to bend slightly inward, forming a natural corridor that urges you onward. There is a strange sense of inevitability, as if you were meant walk this path, to follow the lantern's glow deeper into the darkness.</p>
