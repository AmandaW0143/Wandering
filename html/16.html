            <p>Your fingers brush against the bamboo as you move deeper into the forest. Each mark feels like a clue, drawing you onward. But then, suddenly, you reach a bamboo stalk that is entirely smooth. There were no markings, no signs of the traveler who came before. A few more steps, and still, no new markings. The path ahead feels uncertain now. As you slowly continue forward, a distant <a href="whispers.html">whisper</a> reaches your ear.The whispers seem to come from all around you. Your heart races as you try to locate the sound, but it feels as though the whispers are coming from the bamboos themselves.</p>
