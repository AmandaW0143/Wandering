            <p>The bamboo seems to stretch endlessly, but with every step, the mist gradually thins. The path begins to open up, leading to a small clearing. In the center stands a <a class="content-link" href="shrine.html">small shrine</a>, its wooden frame is worn but strangely well-maintained. The roof is covered in thick layers of moss, and the wooden beams are darkened with age. Carvings of birds and animals can be made out on the beams that support the roof. The walls are bare but for the vines hanging that embrace the shrine. The shrine stands in stark contrast to the fog-drenched forest around it.</p>
