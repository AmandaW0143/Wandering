            <p>You awaken in the heart of a bamboo forest. Your thoughts are sluggish, tangled in the fog around you. You grasp for memories but find nothing. Above, the sky is covered by a thick fog, and the towering stalks of bamboo sway gently. The air hangs with moisture, and the ground beneath you is soft and mossy. A small stone figure sits on the side of the path; it's a panda, carved with meticulous details.</p>
